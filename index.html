            <P>Heart is an American rock band formed in 1970 in Seattle, Washington, which evolved from an existing band, White Heart. By the mid-1970s, original members Roger Fisher (guitar) and Steve Fossen (bass guitar) had been joined by sisters Ann Wilson (lead vocals and flute) and Nancy Wilson (rhythm guitar, backing and occasional lead vocals), Michael Derosier (drums), and Howard Leese (guitar and keyboards) to form the lineup for the band's initial mid- to late-1970s success period.[2] These core members were included in the band's 2013 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[3]

                Heart rose to fame with music influenced by hard rock and heavy metal,[4] as well as folk music. The band's popularity declined in the early 1980s, but the band began a successful comeback in 1985 which continued into the mid-1990s. Heart disbanded in 1998, resumed performing in 2002, went on hiatus in 2016, and resumed performing in the summer of 2019.[5] Heart's US Top 40 singles include "Magic Man" (1975), "Crazy on You" (1976), "Barracuda" (1977), "What About Love" (1985), "Never" (1985), and "All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You" (1990), along with no. 1 hits "These Dreams" (1986) and "Alone" (1987).[6]</P>
